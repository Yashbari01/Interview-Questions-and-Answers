**Redux**

# Basic Level

1) What is Redux?
Answer: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, often used with React to manage application state in a single, central store.

2) What are the core principles of Redux?
Answer: The core principles are a single source of truth (state is stored in a single object), state is read-only (changes are made through actions), and changes are made with pure functions (reducers).

# Intermediate Level

3) What is an action in Redux?
Answer: An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes an event or change to be made in the application state. Actions typically have a type field and an optional payload.

4) What is a reducer in Redux?
Answer: A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state. Reducers handle how the state changes in response to actions.

# Advanced Level

5) How do you handle asynchronous operations in Redux?
Answer: Asynchronous operations can be handled in Redux using middleware such as Redux Thunk or Redux Saga, which allow you to dispatch actions based on async events.

6) What is the Redux DevTools and how is it used?
Answer: The Redux DevTools is a development tool that allows you to inspect every action and state change, time-travel debug, and track changes in the application state.
