# Beginner Level

1. What is JavaScript?
Answer: JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for creating interactive effects within web browsers. It is a key component of web technology, alongside HTML and CSS.

2. Explain the difference between let, const, and var.
Answer:
* var is function-scoped and can be re-declared. It is hoisted to the top of its scope.
* let is block-scoped and cannot be re-declared within the same block. It is also hoisted but not initialized.
* const is block-scoped and must be initialized at the time of declaration. It cannot be reassigned or re-declared.

3. What is the this keyword?
Answer: In JavaScript, this refers to the object that is currently executing the code. Its value depends on where it is used:
* In a method, this refers to the owner object.
* In a function, this refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode).
* In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.

# Intermediate Level

1. Explain closures in JavaScript.
Answer: A closure is a function that captures variables from its surrounding lexical scope even after the outer function has executed. This allows the function to access those variables and their state.

2. How does JavaScript handle asynchronous code?
Answer: JavaScript handles asynchronous code using mechanisms like callbacks, Promises, and async/await. These tools help in managing operations like network requests or timers without blocking the main thread.

3. What is event delegation?
Answer: Event delegation involves using a single event listener to manage events for multiple child elements by leveraging event bubbling. Instead of attaching individual event handlers to each child element, you attach a single handler to a parent element.

# Advanced Level

1. Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance.
Answer: Prototypal inheritance is a feature in JavaScript where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. This is done using prototypes. Each object has a prototype, and objects can link to other objects, forming a prototype chain.

2. What is the event loop in JavaScript?
Answer: The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It continuously checks the message queue and executes tasks from it. This allows for non-blocking I/O operations and makes JavaScript capable of handling asynchronous code efficiently.

3. Describe how async/await works.
Answer: async/await is a syntax in JavaScript that simplifies working with Promises. An async function returns a Promise, and the await keyword is used to wait for a Promise to resolve. It helps in writing asynchronous code in a more synchronous-looking manner.
