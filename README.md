# Introduction
Preparing for a software programming interview can be challenging. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of interview questions and answers that cover essential programming concepts and topics. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you will find valuable resources here to aid your interview preparation.

# Contents

# Basic Questions
1) What is a variable in programming?
- A variable is a storage location identified by a name that holds data which can be modified during program execution.

2) Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
- checks for equality of value, whereas === checks for both value and type equality.

3) What is a loop? Provide an example.
- A loop is a control structure that repeats a block of code while a condition is true. Example: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { console.log(i); }

# Intermediate Questions

4) What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?
- OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to model real-world entities and relationships.

5) Explain the concept of a database transaction.
- A database transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

6) What are RESTful APIs and why are they used?
- RESTful APIs are web services that follow the REST architectural style, allowing interaction with web resources using HTTP methods. They are used for creating scalable and maintainable web services.

# Advanced Questions

7) Describe the differences between a microservices architecture and a monolithic architecture.
- Microservices architecture breaks down an application into smaller, independent services, whereas monolithic architecture consolidates all functionalities into a single codebase.

8) What is the purpose of dependency injection in software design?
- Dependency injection is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) by passing dependencies from the outside rather than creating them inside the class, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.

9) Explain the concept of a deadlock and how to prevent it.
- A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting on the other to release a resource. Prevention methods include resource ordering, timeout, and deadlock detection algorithms.
