**REST API**

# Basic Level

1) What is a REST API?
Answer: A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is an architectural style for designing networked applications that use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

2) What are HTTP methods commonly used in REST APIs?
Answer: The common HTTP methods are GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), PATCH (partial update), and DELETE (remove).

# Intermediate Level

3) What is the purpose of status codes in REST APIs?
Answer: Status codes indicate the result of the HTTP request. For example, 200 OK for successful requests, 404 Not Found for missing resources, and 500 Internal Server Error for server issues.

4) What is HATEOAS in REST?
Answer: HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State) is a constraint of REST that allows clients to navigate an API by following links included in the responses.

# Advanced Level

5) How do you secure a REST API?
Answer: REST APIs can be secured using methods like HTTPS, authentication tokens (e.g., JWT), API keys, OAuth, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

6) What are idempotent and safe methods in REST?
Answer: Idempotent methods produce the same result no matter how many times they are called (e.g., GET, PUT, DELETE). Safe methods do not alter the state of the server (e.g., GET).
